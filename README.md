# Forest Inventory and Analysis Science Stakeholder Meeting 2022: Slides and Materials

## Invited talk: *Improving Forest Inventory Small Area Estimates through Ecological Borrowing and Hierarchical Bayesian Methods*

An invited talk in the *Estimation Methods: Model-based Inferential Paradigms and Tools* session.

### Abstract

The U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) collects inventory data on and computes estimates for many forest attributes to monitor the status and trends of the nation's forests. Increasingly, FIA needs to produce estimates in small geographic and temporal regions. In this application, we implement four Fay-Herriot area level hierarchical Bayesian (HB) estimators that borrow strength across ecological provinces and sections and consider prior information on the between-area variation of the response variables. We compare the performance of these HB estimators to the analogous Fay-Herriot area level empirical best linear unbiased prediction (EBLUP) estimator and to the industry-standard post-stratified (PS) direct estimator in diverse ecological regions in the interior western United States. Results suggest that when producing estimates in this HB framework and using weakly informative priors, we can reduce variance substantially compared to the analogous EBLUP estimator and the PS estimator.
